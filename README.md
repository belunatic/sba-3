## Overview

The challenge is to take the given design and code it using Bootstrap Framework. [Testimonials grid section challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/testimonials-grid-section-Nnw6J7Un7)

## Approach

- I linked the Bootstrap Framework
- Used it to design my containers and size up columns for both mobile and desktop
- I used custom styling to add specific colors, border-radius, font-size, font-family and a background-image

## Challenges

- I need to add CSS specificity to overwrite the Bootstrap classes.
- Added custom styling to cover some bases for the styling that Bootstrap was not able to give me
- the bloating of HTML code made it very hard to follow and keep track of the nested div

## Reflection

Bootstrap Framework is a great tool to use and it is very powerful. It makes web development faster du to it feature of container, row, and column set-up, it is real a good framework to use for a Grid Styling Design.

The issues I had with it were the needs to add custom styling to fix some of the things it was lacking; the nesting of my HTML due to use of class like container, row made my code way to big, hard to read, and hard to fix issues. So I had to start small and build from it

It is an amazing tool but I will definitely look for another framework to work with. At the moment Tailwind CSS is ideal.
