												incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter. The next
												12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
												life. Since completing the course, I‚Äôve successfully
												switched careers, working as a Software Engineer at a VR
												startup. ‚Äù

										‚Äú Before joining the bootcamp, I‚Äôve never written a line of
										code. I needed some structure from professionals who can
										help me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to
										enroll by a former student of theirs who can only say
										wonderful things about the program. The entire curriculum
										and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I
										never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
										project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning
										to the next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have.
										In fact, I‚Äôve often referred to it during interviews as an
										example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me
										land a job as a full-stack developer after receiving
										multiple offers. 100% recommend! ‚Äù
